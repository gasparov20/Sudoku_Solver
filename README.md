# Sudoku_Solver
Reads an input file containing coordinates and values to populate a Sudoku board object. Then, using a backtracking approach, solves the board and prints the result. Includes metrics such as number of times backtracked, number of integer comparisons to solve, time taken to solve, number of failed attempts to place a candidate solution, and whether the solution is unique or not.
